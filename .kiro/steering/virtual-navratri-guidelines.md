# Virtual Navratri Experience Guidelines

## Project Overview
This is a romantic virtual Navratri experience designed for distant couples to celebrate the festival together. The app creates an immersive journey that simulates picking up your partner and going through various festival activities, culminating in a beautiful proposal moment.

## Design Principles

### 1. Romantic & Festive Theme
- Use warm, festive colors (oranges, pinks, reds, purples)
- Include traditional Navratri elements (diyas, dandiya, music)
- Maintain a romantic undertone throughout the experience

- Personal touches like favorite foods (Rajma Chawal for girl)

### 2. Progressive Journey Structure
The app follows a specific flow:
1. **Home Screen** - Personalized welcome message for girl
2. **Car Animation** - Romantic pickup from hostel with smooth animations

4. **Activity Screens** - Interactive experiences (optional for Dance/Play)
5. **Food Corner** - EXCLUSIVE path to romantic sequence (requires 3 selections)

7. **Happy Ending** - Local photos of moon and girl with romantic messages
8. **Proposal Screen** - The main romantic moment with ring animation
